# Image-Processing

A collection of Python scripts and demos showcasing foundational image processing techniques — from filtering to enhancement — built using libraries like OpenCV and NumPy.

---

##  Techniques Covered

### 1. Image Filtering
- Implementations of mean (averaging), median, and Gaussian filters.
- Demos: Blurring noisy images, smoothing artifacts.

### 2. Edge Detection
- Methods: Sobel, Prewitt, Canny.
- Demos: Detection of edges, outlines, and object boundaries.

### 3. Histogram Equalization
- Enhances contrast in grayscale images.
- Demo: Brightness normalization for low-contrast photos.

### 4. Morphological Operations
- Techniques: Erosion, dilation, opening, closing.
- Demos: Noise removal, shape refinement.
